## Objectives
Deliver a presentation for adquiring Satellite Imagery for road quality assestment using UP42 platform and SDK.


## Business Definition

The business mentioned their algorithm for road quality assestment works best on data with a resolution of 50cm or less. The preference is for 30cm data where possible and filling in with 50cm when needed. They are interested in finding data from May 2023 to the end of September 2023. They would like us to find all available catalog data over the shared AOI called `road_alignment.geojson` and are interested in a corridor that is 500m wide (250m buffer).

## Challenge

The challenge involves:

1. Exploring available catalogs
2. Retrieving catalog data
3. Exporting and plotting search results
4. Estimating credits
5. Computing coverage for remaining areas not covered by catalog data
6. Providing suggestions for areas that are not covered by API-integrated catalog data
